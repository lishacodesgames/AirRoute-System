# How to Build on Windows
Run the build.bat file

#### 2 ways to run batch file:
<ol>
   <li> Normal Mode: Will show the files compiling as they compile </li>
   <li> Quick Mode: append " quick" to normal run command to enable quick mode, will skip the outputs and directly compile into AirRouteSystem.exe </li>
</ol>

**Both work just fine. Depends on your patience / trust in your compiler**
