g++ -std=c++17 src/main.cpp src/core/*.cpp src/services/*.cpp src/storage/*.cpp src/ui/*.cpp src/utils/*.cpp -Iinclude -o build/air_route.exe
WINDOWS RUN COMMAND: with .exe
MAC/LINUX RUN COMMAND: without .exe

note: does not compile frontend/ or raylib at all

-> just made a .bat file lol so easy
-> bcz i wanna run with cmd and cmd doesn't expand *.cpp and also running "build.bat" is much easier than this whole command
